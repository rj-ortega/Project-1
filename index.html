      <h1>The King of Teas</h1>
      <p>Yerba Mate is a tea that has its roots in south america and continues to grow in popularity because of its many health benefits 
        and the community aspect it
        brings to the table. It is highly caffeinated but, contrary to coffee,
        doesnt have the notorious "crash" that many people experience. It has a higher count
        of antioxidants than most other teas as well as vitamin B and C making it a very healthy drink.
        It continuous to grow in popularity around the globe but it's most popular in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia,
        Chile and Brazil. In Paraguay and regions around it (northearstern Argentina and southern Brazil)
        a cold water infusion of Yerba Mate called Tereré is a very popular alternative to the traditional
        drinking method with hot water. To drink Yerba Mate all you need is a Bombilla (straw that serves also as a sieve), a gourd,
        the Yerba Mate itself and, of course, cold/hot water. Some people also choose to infuse the water or add different ingredients
        to the gourd to enhance the flavour but it's completely optional.</p>
      <p>I was first introduced to Mate many years ago and it's been a
        part of my life ever since. Much like my friend who introduced me to it, I love any
        chance I get to help spread it to anyone willing to try it. I would definetely consider it
        an acquired taste but most people will give it a shot. So is it better than coffee? Obviously that is a
        highly subjective question. I love both and depending on the situation I may
        choose one over the other. Do I need a quick burst of energy to get me going in
        the morning? Nothing like an espresso shot for that. Do I need sustain energy
        thoughtout the morning and afternoon while I study/work? Mate is my go to
        in this scenario. Am I doing any sort of physical activity with friends? Mate! Or tereré if it's warm outside.</p>
      <p> I also love the break it gives me while
        I'm working on something. Very similar to the break cigarrette smokers take to get a
        fix of nicotine, only not as long.
        In fact lack of having that break is one of the reasons I (and
        many other smokers I've talked to) had a hard time quitting cigarrettes so potential benefit there? Taking a short break
        in my opinion helps you gather your thoughts, lets your brain breath and, if you so choose, you can share this
        moment with someone and stay connected to those around you.</p>
      <p>Mate is one of the best things I've been introduced to and has been a part of many
        bonding conversations with friends and many productive sessions. So go out, get your own bombilla
        and start enjoying.</p>
